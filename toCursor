In my existing project, generate favicon from the logo and add it to the project.

I want to add authentication based access, so by default we will give only one option to sign in with google, so create a design for the same which aligns with the current project context.

Integrate supabase with the project, and I want to capture user details, user agent details with user ip and also most possible data we can capture, I also want to capture prompt, with input output and other data etc.

Give me create tables syntax for all of the above and start integrating the same.

Add security to the api, such as no one can access api from external api client, rather api will only be called by UI only.

Also change the gradient colors used and make it look different and elegant.

Also I dont want to keep my OPENAI_API_KEY in env file as is hardcoded, instead can you make the functionality in such a way that it is encrypted and code will need to decrypt it and then use it?
